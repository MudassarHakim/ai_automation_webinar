### 1. Market Research (Deep Research)

This phase involves exploring your market comprehensively, focusing on trends, behavior, and opportunities.

#### Methods

**Topic Research:**
Understand the core topics in your market. Explore why these topics matter to your audience by watching videos, reading blogs, and researching across platforms like YouTube, Medium, etc.

**YouTube Video Comments:**
Pay attention to the comments on relevant YouTube videos to discover audience pain points, questions, and key interests.

**YouTube Thumbnails, Titles & Views:**
Analyze popular videos' thumbnails and titles. Note the types of images, colors, and words that attract viewers. The number of views and comments helps estimate the market size and engagement level.

**Amazon Reviews:**
Check product reviews, especially in your niche. Both positive and negative reviews will give insights into what people like or dislike. Look at book titles and indexes to find attention-grabbing words and topics.

**Google Trends:**
Use Google Trends to track top searches in your market and compare them with other industries to assess interest levels.

**Google Keyword Planner:**
Find the words and phrases people are using most frequently. Use this data to craft headlines, copy, and messaging that resonate.

**Course Platforms (Udemy, Coursera):**
Research the number of courses available in your niche, read reviews, and analyze course structures to understand market demand.

### 2. Competitor Research (Smart Research)

Research not only provides you with market insights but also helps you make informed decisions on what not to do. By understanding the successes and failures in your market, you can quickly gather inspiration and avoid potential pitfalls. To make the most of this research, it's essential to master the basics and develop sharp observation skills.

#### Key Focus Areas for Competitor Research

When analyzing competitors, focus on their:

- Messaging
- Headlines
- Structure and flow of their content
- Tools and platforms they use
- Visual elements and backgrounds
- Key success factors (what's winning for them)

#### Direct vs. Indirect Competitors

**Direct Competitors:**
Direct competitors are businesses offering the same product or service as you. For example, Amazon and Flipkart, or Swiggy and Zomato. By analyzing direct competitors, you can identify the strategies, messaging, and ideas that are working in your niche.

**Indirect Competitors:**
Indirect competitors don't sell the same product but target a similar audience within your market. For instance, Nykaa and Amazon, or PhonePe and Upstox. Researching indirect competitors helps you understand broader market strategies and trends that could work for your business.

#### Steps for Effective Competitor Research

**Ask the Client for Competitor Information:**
If the client has a list of competitors, request it. If not, you'll need to conduct research to identify relevant competitors.

**Create a Competitor List:**
Make a list of at least 5 direct or indirect competitors. For each, include:
- Their name
- Website URL
- Social media profiles
- Landing page links

**Keyword Research (Keyword List to Research):**
Alongside competitor research, identify the most searched keywords in your market. Create a list of top-performing keywords and include related terms you think are relevant to your niche, even if they're based on assumptions.

#### Methods

**Ads Library Research:**
Use the Facebook Ads Library to search for your competitors. Analyze their active ads -- focus on headlines, visuals, CTA buttons, and content. Take note of any ads that have been running for a long time (indicating success) and capture your observations.

**Video Ad Analysis:**
Watch your competitor's video ads and break them down: words used, style, hooks, editing techniques, calls-to-action (CTAs), and offers.

**Landing Page Analysis:**
Click on competitor ads to explore their landing pages. Observe and take notes on headlines, structure, visuals, CTA buttons, bonuses, and pricing. Screenshots and detailed notes will help you decode their messaging templates.

**Email Lists:**
Subscribe to competitor email lists to analyze the types of emails they send -- structure, subject lines, and overall content strategy.

**Social Media Analysis:**
Study competitors' social media accounts (Instagram, YouTube, etc.). Analyze their content, number of followers, and engagement levels. This will help you decode their content strategy.

**Course & Webinar Analysis:**
Look at competitor websites to see what courses they offer and their pricing. Attend their webinars or workshops to observe their teaching style, offers, and deliverables.

**Google Ads:**
Check if competitors are running Google Ads (Search, YouTube). Analyze headlines and ad creatives.

### 3. Clarity Research (Client-Specific Research)

This is customized research that dives deep into understanding the client's past performance, business history, and advertising results.

#### Methods

**Client Background:**
Learn about your client's business history, experience, products, and previous marketing strategies. This can include discussions with the client, reviewing their website and social media.

**Ad Account Analysis:**
Access the client's ad account to review past campaigns. Note what has worked, analyze CPM (Cost per Mille), CTR (Click-through rate), and other performance metrics. This will help you identify what's already working and where improvements can be made.

**Pixel & Events:**
Ensure that the Facebook Pixel and event tracking are correctly set up on the client's website.

**Sales & Leads Data:**
Gather historical data on sales, leads, webinars, and ROAS (Return on Ad Spend). Understanding past performance helps you identify gaps and improve strategies.

**Strategy Planning:**
Based on the research, develop a clear strategy to help the client achieve their revenue goals. All notes and findings should be clearly documented in your research doc.
