## 3. Best Practices from Research (Conversion Optimization)

### Must-Have Elements (current page is missing some):
1. **Anchored pricing** -- Show original price crossed out, then FREE (Newton School does ~~Rs 4,999~~ FREE)
2. **Specific date/time** -- Clear event date with timezone (missing on current page)
3. **Live attendee counter** -- "X people registered" (Newton School uses 500+)
4. **Speaker/trainer credibility** -- More prominent authority signals
5. **Specific tool logos** -- Show the actual tools being used (Cursor, Claude, etc.)
6. **News/media references** -- Borrowed authority from real headlines
7. **"Not for you if..."** -- Exclusivity filter that paradoxically increases registrations
8. **Career stage segmentation** -- Speak to different experience levels
9. **Strikethrough pricing** -- Even for free events, anchoring against a price dramatically increases perceived value

### Elements Current Page Does Well:
- Strong hero headline ("Stop Being an AI Consumer. Become an AI Builder")
- Fear + Hope narrative (good storytelling arc)
- Two paths comparison (Path A vs Path B)
- Countdown timer
- Sticky footer CTA
- Social proof popup
- Bonuses section
- FAQ section
- Mobile-friendly design

## 4. Actionable Improvements to Implement

### HIGH IMPACT (implement now):
1. **Add anchored pricing** -- Show "Worth Rs 4,999" crossed out, then FREE prominently near CTA
2. **Add webinar date/time** -- Specific date, time, and timezone in hero section
3. **Add live registration counter** -- "2,000+ builders already registered" near hero CTA
4. **Add tool logos strip** -- Show Cursor, Claude, Replit, etc. logos below hero
5. **Add "Not for you if..." exclusivity** -- in the "Who This Is For" section
6. **Add celebrity/industry quotes** -- Satya Nadella, Sam Altman, etc. quotes about AI builders
7. **Update year reference** -- "In 2024, everyone knows how to ask ChatGPT" should be 2025/2026

### MEDIUM IMPACT:
8. **Career stage badges** -- Add experience level targeting (like Newton School)
9. **Specific outcomes with numbers** -- "Ship your first AI agent in 30 minutes"
10. **Strikethrough in modal** -- Show value anchor in the registration modal too
